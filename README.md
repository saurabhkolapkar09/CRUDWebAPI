# CRUDWebAPI

- A .NET Core Web API application demonstrating CRUD operations with Entity Framework, implementing security best practices and clean architecture patterns.
## Overview
- This Web API application showcases modern .NET development practices including:

- CRUD Operations - Complete Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality using Entity Framework Core
- Repository Pattern - Clean architecture implementation following OOP principles for maintainable code
- JWT Authentication - Secure token-based authentication and authorization system
- CORS Support - Cross-origin resource sharing configuration for client-server communication
- RESTful Design - Following REST architectural principles for API endpoints

## Technologies Used

- .NET Core Web API - Backend framework
- Entity Framework Core - Object-relational mapping for database operations
- SQL Server - Database management system
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) - Authentication and authorization
- Repository Pattern - Data access abstraction layer

## Key Features
### Security Implementation

- JWT token-based authentication with configurable expiration
- Role-based authorization (Admin role implementation)
- CORS policy configuration for cross-origin requests
- Secure token signing using HMAC-SHA256 algorithm

### Architecture Highlights

- Clean separation of concerns using Repository Pattern
- Generic repository interface for reusable data operations
- Entity Framework integration for database operations
- RESTful API design with standard HTTP methods

### Development Benefits

- Scalable and maintainable codebase structure
- Demonstrates industry-standard security practices
- Educational resource for learning .NET Core Web API development
- Production-ready authentication implementation


- The API provides endpoints for user authentication and CRUD operations with proper authorization controls.
